ChronoSim is a dynamic simulation framework designed to showcase the interactions and decision-making processes of virtual entities ("Entellecs") within an evolving environment. With an integrated time system and changing seasons, it offers a unique perspective into the life cycles and interactions of Entellecs.

# Features
## 1. Entity Neural Networks:
Each Entellect is equipped with a neural network to make decisions based on its environment and state.
## 2. Dynamic Time System
Simulates the passage of time, with days and seasons. This system influences Entellect behavior, especially when environmental factors become challenging.
## 3. Season Dynamics
Experience the changing seasons and observe how they influence the behavior of Entellects.
## 4. Reproduction Mechanism
Entellects can reproduce based on certain criteria, introducing offspring into the simulation.
## 5. Resource Gathering and Management
Entellects make decisions to gather and utilize resources in their environment. Resources can be used to construct shelters or exchanged with other Entellects.
## 6. Dynamic Movement
Instead of rigid, grid-based movement, Entellects have fluid movement capabilities. They can move in any directed based on an angle, making their motion more natural and organic.
## 7. Interactions:
Entellects can interact with:
## - Food Sources:
Entellects gain energy by consuming food sources.
## - Shelters
Entellects seek out shelters or construct their own, providing protection from environmental challenges.
## - Other Entellects
Entellects engage in a variety of interactions, such as:
- Communication: Strengthen relationships and share knowledge
- Exchange: Swap resources based on needs and availability
- Conflict: Engage in disagreements, leading to energy loss and strained relationships
# 8. Relationship Dynamics:
Entellects maintain relationships with each other. Depending on past interactions, they can have positive, neutral, or negative relationships, which influence future interactions.
# 9. Simulation Graphics
A basic Pygame-based graphicaly representation allows you to watch the Entellects in action, moving around the enivornment and interacting with various elements.
