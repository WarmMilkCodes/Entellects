ChronoSim is a dynamic simulation framework designed to showcase the interactions and decision-making processes of virtual entities within an evolving environment. With an integrated time system and changing seasons, it offers a unique perspective into the life cycles and interactions of these entities.

# Features
- Entity Neural Networks: Each entity is equipped with an neural network to make decisions based on its environment and state.
- Dynamic Time System: Simulates the passage of time, with each real-world minute representing an hour in the simulation.
- Season Dynamics: Experience the changing seasons and observe how they influence the behavior of entities.
- Reproduction Mechanism: Entities can reproduce based on certain criteria, introducing offspring into the simulation.
- Resource Gathering: Entities make decisions to gather and utilize resources in their environment.

  # Future Goals
  - Community Building: Introduce complex interactions allowing entities to form communities.
  - Ecological Dynamics: Incorporate predators, different terrains, and more varied resources to enrich the ecosystem.
  - Learning Mechanisms: Enhance the AI capabilities to allow entities to learn from their experiences.
