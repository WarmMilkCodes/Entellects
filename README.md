Entellects is a dynamic simulation framework designed to showcase the interactions and decision-making processes of virtual entities known as "Entellects." Set within an evolving environment featuring an integrated time system and changing seasons, it offers a unique glimpse into the life cycles, behaviors, and interactions of Entellects.

# Features
## 1. Entity Neural Networks
Each Entellect utilizes a neural network for decision-making based on environmental and personal states.
## 2. Dynamic Time System
Simulate the flow of time, complete with days and seasonal changes, affecting Entellect behaviors and environmental challenges.
## 3. Season Dynamics
Observe the influence of changing seasons on Entellect behavior.
## 4. Reproduction Mechanism
Entellects gather and utilize resources, which can be used for shelter construction or exchanged with others.
## 5. Resource Gathering and Management
Entellects make decisions to gather and utilize resources in their environment. Resources can be used to construct shelters or exchanged with other Entellects.
## 6. Dynamic Movement
Fluid and angle-based movement allows Entellects to navigate their environment organically.
## 7. Interactions
Entellects interact with...
## - Food Sources:
For energy replenishment.
## - Shelters
Offering protection from environmental factors.
## - Fellow Entellects
Through communication, resource exchange, and occasional conflicts.
## 8. Relationship Dynamics:
Past interactions shape the relationships between Entellects, influencing future engagements.
## 9. Simulation Graphics
Witness the simulation in action with a basic Pygame-based visual representation.
